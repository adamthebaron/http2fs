http/2 for 9front

started during the butler summer institute of butler university, 2017
hpack compression added in 2018 for butler urc
continued in 2019 for fun and to hopefully show off

now written using p9p on linux and macos

dont use this im refactoring it right now and it wont work


source structure

h_* hpack functions
u_* utility functions
n_* network functions
t_* threading functions
9_* 9p functions

big todo things

- add support for tls through libsec
- isoloate all hpack code and keep it in a dir or something
- make sure that each thread has its own copy of dynamic header table
  and streams and the like
- get proper 9p support (the only thing that matters)
