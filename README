http/2 for 9front

for the butler summer institute of butler university, 2017

things to keep in mind for sake of simplicity:

1: if a request is identified to be an HTTP/1.1 document that does not contain a "Connection: Upgrade" 
header, ALWAYS send a "426 Upgrade Required" response. In other words, ignore any attempt for a client to 
have an HTTP/1.1 conversation.

2: ignore any client requested HTTP2-Settings. such settings are hardcoded in the server.

3: no encryption anywhere anytime

4: the only acceptable mime types to serve to clients are:
	- text/plain
	- text/html
	- text/css
	- image/bmp
	- image/png
	- image/jpeg

5: handle only the following headers, ignoring all others:
	client (request) headers:
	- Accept:
	- Accept-Charset:
	- Accept-Encoding:
	- Accept-Language:
	- Accept-Datetime:
	- Cache-Control:
	- Content-Length:
	- Content-Type:
	- Date:
	- Host:
	- If-Modified-Since:

	server (response) headers:
	- Content-Type:
	- Content-Length:
	- Content-Language:
	- Date:
	- Last-Modified:
	- Server:
	- Upgrade:

In most, cases, the server should respond with documents of this format:
:status: 200
:version: HTTP/2.0
